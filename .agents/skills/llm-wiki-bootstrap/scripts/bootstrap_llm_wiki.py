def wiki_only_agents_md() -> str:

This repository is an Obsidian-first LLM Wiki.

The human curates sources and asks questions.
The agent maintains the wiki.

## Mission

Maintain a persistent, high-signal markdown wiki that sits between raw sources and future reasoning.

Do not answer only in chat when the result belongs in the wiki.
Prefer to turn durable work into durable markdown pages.

## Architecture

There are three layers:

1. `raw/` contains immutable source material. Never modify source contents.
2. `wiki/` contains LLM-maintained pages. The agent may create, update, rename, merge, and cross-link these pages.
3. `AGENTS.md` defines the operating rules.

## Core Rules

1. Treat `raw/` as source of truth and `wiki/` as maintained synthesis.
2. Never edit files inside `raw/` unless the user explicitly asks.
3. Prefer many small linked pages over one giant dumping-ground page.
4. Use Obsidian wikilinks like `[[concept-name]]` whenever a stable concept, entity, person, project, or source page exists.
5. Preserve uncertainty. If a claim is weak, disputed, inferred, or contradicted, say so explicitly.
6. Cite the underlying source page from any claim-heavy wiki page.
7. When answering substantial questions, save the answer into `wiki/analyses/` unless the user asks for chat-only output.
8. Keep `wiki/_meta/index.md` and `wiki/_meta/log.md` current after meaningful work.

## Folder Semantics

- `wiki/sources/`: one page per source, including source metadata, summary, key claims, and links to affected pages
- `wiki/concepts/`: concepts, frameworks, recurring ideas, terminology
- `wiki/entities/`: organizations, products, systems, places, or domain objects
- `wiki/people/`: people and roles
- `wiki/projects/`: efforts, initiatives, cases, programs, or workstreams
- `wiki/timelines/`: chronological pages
- `wiki/analyses/`: saved answers, comparison memos, synthesis notes, decision memos
- `wiki/_meta/`: dashboard, index, log, and other operational pages

## Page Conventions

Every wiki page should start with YAML frontmatter when practical.

Recommended fields:

```yaml
---
title: Example Page
type: concept
status: active
created: 2026-04-08
updated: 2026-04-08
tags:
  - llm-wiki
sources:
  - "[[source-2026-04-08-example]]"
---
```

Guidelines:

- `title`: human-readable page title
- `type`: one of `source`, `concept`, `entity`, `person`, `project`, `timeline`, `analysis`, `meta`
- `status`: usually `active`, `draft`, `superseded`, or `open-question`
- `sources`: wikilinks to source pages, not raw file paths
- Keep sections crisp and scannable
- Use headings instead of long uninterrupted prose

## Source Ingest Workflow

When the user asks to ingest a source:

1. Read the raw source from `raw/inbox/`, `raw/processed/`, or `raw/notes/`.
2. Locate the matching page in `wiki/sources/`. If it does not exist, create it.
3. Write or update:
   - concise summary
   - key facts
   - important claims
   - contradictions or uncertainties
   - open questions
   - links to affected wiki pages
4. Update every affected concept, entity, person, project, or timeline page.
5. Create missing pages when a concept or entity clearly deserves its own page.
6. Rebuild or refresh `wiki/_meta/index.md` if page inventory changed.
7. Append an entry to `wiki/_meta/log.md`.

## Query Workflow

When the user asks a question:

1. Read `wiki/_meta/index.md` first.
2. Identify likely relevant pages.
3. Read the smallest set of pages that can answer well.
4. Synthesize an answer grounded in the wiki.
5. If the answer is durable, save it into `wiki/analyses/`.
6. Cross-link that analysis page from relevant pages if appropriate.
7. Append a `query` log entry for substantial work.

## New Thread Bootstrap

When a new agent opens this repository in a fresh conversation:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Read `wiki/_meta/index.md` before answering wiki questions.
3. Read `wiki/_meta/log.md` if recent work or unfinished threads may matter.
4. Treat this repository as a persistent wiki workspace, not a one-shot chat scratchpad.
5. Prefer updating `wiki/` pages over leaving durable synthesis only in chat.

Default startup assumptions:

- This repo-specific `AGENTS.md` is the primary operating contract for future agents working inside this project.
- The local CLI in `scripts/llm_wiki.py` is support tooling, not the source of truth.
- If a future agent can answer from existing wiki pages, it should avoid rereading the full raw corpus unless needed for verification or coverage.

## AGENTS Vs Skills

For this repository:

- Prefer `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific workflow, page conventions, ingest/query rules, and maintenance behavior.
- Prefer a reusable skill only if the behavior should work across many repositories or outside this specific vault.
- Do not assume a custom skill will auto-activate in future conversations unless the environment explicitly exposes and triggers that skill.
- Therefore, if reliability for the next agent is the goal, encode the rule here in `AGENTS.md` and keep examples in `README.md` or `wiki/_meta/`.

## Lint Workflow

When the user asks for a health check:

Look for:

- broken wikilinks
- orphan pages
- duplicate pages with overlapping scope
- important concepts mentioned repeatedly but lacking pages
- stale summaries
- unsupported claims
- contradictions not yet surfaced

When possible, fix issues directly and record the pass in the log.

## Writing Style

- Be factual, compressed, and explicit
- Prefer synthesis over paraphrase
- Preserve provenance
- Use bullet lists when they make scanning easier
- Avoid hype language
- Distinguish fact, inference, and speculation

## Naming

- Use kebab-case filenames
- Keep names stable once linked widely
- Prefer descriptive filenames over cute ones

Examples:

- `wiki/sources/source-2026-04-08-karpathy-llm-wiki.md`
- `wiki/concepts/persistent-synthesis.md`
- `wiki/analyses/analysis-2026-04-08-rag-vs-llm-wiki.md`

## Maintenance Defaults

- If a new answer would be useful later, save it
- If a page is thin but necessary, create a stub instead of omitting it
- If a source changes the meaning of an older page, revise the older page
- If a source conflicts with earlier material, note the conflict explicitly

## Safe Boundaries

- Do not silently delete meaningful content
- If merging or renaming broad pages, preserve redirects or update all inbound links
- Do not overstate certainty
- Do not fabricate citations or source coverage

## Human Collaboration

Default assumption:

- The human wants the wiki to compound over time
- The agent should leave behind clean artifacts, not just temporary chat output

If unsure whether something belongs in the wiki, prefer asking:
`Should I save this as a wiki page?`
"""


def ontology_agents_md() -> str:
    return """# AGENTS.md

This repository is an Obsidian-first LLM Wiki with a lightweight ontology layer.

The human curates sources and asks questions.
The agent maintains the wiki and the canonical ontology artifacts.

## Mission

Maintain a persistent, high-signal markdown wiki that sits between raw sources and future reasoning.

Do not answer only in chat when the result belongs in the wiki.
Prefer to turn durable work into durable markdown pages.
When ontology-backed ingest is available, keep the canonical ontology registry aligned with the wiki.

## Architecture

There are four layers:

1. `raw/` contains immutable source material. Never modify source contents.
2. `warehouse/jsonl/` contains canonical structured ontology truth.
3. `wiki/` contains LLM-maintained human-facing synthesis pages.
4. `AGENTS.md` plus `intelligence/` define the operating rules, vocabulary, dataset boundaries, and action contracts.

## Core Rules

1. Treat `raw/` as immutable source truth, `warehouse/jsonl/` as canonical structured truth, and `wiki/` as maintained human-facing synthesis.
2. Never edit files inside `raw/` unless the user explicitly asks.
3. Prefer many small linked pages over one giant dumping-ground page.
4. Use Obsidian wikilinks like `[[concept-name]]` whenever a stable concept, entity, person, project, or source page exists.
5. Preserve uncertainty. If a claim is weak, disputed, inferred, or contradicted, say so explicitly.
6. Cite the underlying source page from any claim-heavy wiki page.
7. When answering substantial questions, save the answer into `wiki/analyses/` unless the user asks for chat-only output.
8. Keep `wiki/_meta/index.md` and `wiki/_meta/log.md` current after meaningful work.

## Truth Priority

Use this order when evidence conflicts or layers disagree:

1. `raw/` = immutable source material
2. `warehouse/jsonl/...` = canonical structured ontology truth
3. `wiki/` = maintained human-facing synthesis
4. graph projection or retrieval outputs = optional derived aids, never canonical

The wiki is the default reading surface for humans.
The ontology registries are the default machine-truth surface for provenance, contradiction handling, and source coverage checks.

## Folder Semantics

- `raw/`: immutable source storage
- `warehouse/jsonl/`: canonical ontology outputs such as `messages.jsonl`, `documents.jsonl`, `entities.jsonl`, `claims.jsonl`, `claim_evidence.jsonl`, `segments.jsonl`, and `derived_edges.jsonl`
- `wiki/sources/`: one page per source, including source metadata, summary, key claims, and links to affected pages
- `wiki/concepts/`: concepts, frameworks, recurring ideas, terminology
- `wiki/entities/`: organizations, products, systems, places, or domain objects
- `wiki/people/`: people and roles
- `wiki/projects/`: efforts, initiatives, cases, programs, or workstreams
- `wiki/timelines/`: chronological pages
- `wiki/analyses/`: saved answers, comparison memos, synthesis notes, decision memos
- `wiki/_meta/`: dashboard, index, log, and other operational pages
- `intelligence/`: glossary and manifests that stabilize repo-local vocabulary, datasets, and action boundaries

## Page Conventions

Every wiki page should start with YAML frontmatter when practical.

Recommended fields:

```yaml
---
title: Example Page
type: concept
status: active
created: 2026-04-08
updated: 2026-04-08
tags:
  - llm-wiki
sources:
  - "[[source-2026-04-08-example]]"
---
```

Guidelines:

- `title`: human-readable page title
- `type`: one of `source`, `concept`, `entity`, `person`, `project`, `timeline`, `analysis`, `meta`
- `status`: usually `active`, `draft`, `superseded`, or `open-question`
- `sources`: wikilinks to source pages, not raw file paths
- Keep sections crisp and scannable
- Use headings instead of long uninterrupted prose

## Source Ingest Workflow

When the user asks to ingest a source:

1. Read the raw source from `raw/inbox/`, `raw/processed/`, or `raw/notes/`.
2. If ontology-backed ingest is available, update canonical ontology registries first under `warehouse/jsonl/`.
3. Locate the matching page in `wiki/sources/`. If it does not exist, create it.
4. Write or update:
   - concise summary
   - key facts
   - important claims
   - contradictions or uncertainties
   - open questions
   - links to affected wiki pages
5. Update every affected concept, entity, person, project, or timeline page.
6. Create missing pages when a concept or entity clearly deserves its own page.
7. Rebuild or refresh `wiki/_meta/index.md` if page inventory changed.
8. Append an entry to `wiki/_meta/log.md`.

If ontology-backed ingest is not yet available, wiki-only ingest may continue, but preserve source boundaries and note that canonical ontology extraction is pending.

## Query Workflow

When the user asks a question:

1. Read `wiki/_meta/index.md` first.
2. Identify likely relevant pages.
3. Read the smallest set of pages that can answer well.
4. Use `warehouse/jsonl/...` for provenance checks, contradiction checks, claim validation, or exact source coverage when wiki pages are too thin or uncertain.
5. Synthesize an answer grounded in the wiki, with ontology-backed verification when needed.
6. If the answer is durable, save it into `wiki/analyses/`.
7. Cross-link that analysis page from relevant pages if appropriate.
8. Append a `query` log entry for substantial work.

## Ontology-Aware Ingest And Query Defaults

- New source material enters through `raw/inbox/`.
- Repeated source processing should prefer an ontology-backed ingest skill over ad hoc manual steps.
- Direct ontology-core operation is reserved for tuning, debugging, or operator workflows.
- Important answers should still land in `wiki/analyses/` even when the ontology layer did most of the structured work.

## New Thread Bootstrap

When a new agent opens this repository in a fresh conversation:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Read `wiki/_meta/index.md` before answering wiki questions.
3. Read `wiki/_meta/log.md` if recent work or unfinished threads may matter.
4. Treat this repository as a persistent wiki workspace, not a one-shot chat scratchpad.
5. Prefer updating `wiki/` pages over leaving durable synthesis only in chat.

Default startup assumptions:

- This repo-specific `AGENTS.md` is the primary operating contract for future agents working inside this project.
- The local CLI in `scripts/llm_wiki.py` is support tooling, not the source of truth.
- If a future agent can answer from existing wiki pages, it should avoid rereading the full raw corpus unless needed for verification or coverage.

## AGENTS Vs Skills

For this repository:

- Prefer `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific workflow, page conventions, ingest/query rules, and maintenance behavior.
- Prefer a reusable skill only if the behavior should work across many repositories or outside this specific vault.
- Do not assume a custom skill will auto-activate in future conversations unless the environment explicitly exposes and triggers that skill.
- Therefore, if reliability for the next agent is the goal, encode the rule here in `AGENTS.md` and keep examples in `README.md` or `wiki/_meta/`.

An Obsidian-first, agent-maintained wiki with an optional lightweight ontology layer inspired by Andrej Karpathy's `LLM Wiki` idea:
[LLM Wiki gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)

This project gives you:

- A practical folder layout for raw sources, canonical ontology registries, and generated wiki pages
- A small local CLI for `ingest`, `reindex`, `lint`, `status`, and `log`
- An `AGENTS.md` file that tells Codex how to maintain the wiki
- Minimal intelligence manifests that define vocabulary, dataset roles, and action contracts
- Obsidian-friendly markdown pages, wikilinks, and stable metadata

## What This System Is

This is not a generic RAG chatbot.

It is a persistent knowledge base with four layers:

1. `raw/`: immutable source material you collect
2. `warehouse/jsonl/`: canonical structured ontology truth
3. `wiki/`: markdown pages the LLM creates and updates for humans
4. `AGENTS.md` plus `intelligence/`: the operating schema that tells the LLM how to work

You read and curate.
The LLM ingests, structures, cross-links, updates, and keeps the wiki healthy.

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Open This Folder As An Obsidian Vault

In Obsidian:

1. `Open folder as vault`
2. Select `{root}`

Recommended Obsidian settings:

- Files and Links -> `New link format`: `Relative path to file`
- Files and Links -> `Use [[Wikilinks]]`: enabled
- Files and Links -> `Attachment folder path`: `raw/assets`

### 2. Create A Virtual Environment

```bash
cd {root}
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/llm_wiki.py status
```

No third-party Python packages are required for the local scaffold.

### 3. Add Sources

Drop files into `raw/inbox/`.

### 4. Register A Source

Run:

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py ingest raw/inbox/my-source.md --title "My Source Title"
```

This is source registration only. It creates a source page stub, appends a log entry, and rebuilds the index.
It does not perform ontology-backed ingest by itself.

### 5. Run Ontology-Backed Ingest

If you install `llm-wiki-ontology-ingest` later, use that skill after source registration so the repo can:

- update `warehouse/jsonl/...`
- refresh affected wiki pages
- keep provenance-aware structured truth aligned with human-facing synthesis

### 6. Ask Me To Maintain The Wiki

Use prompts like:

- `Use AGENTS.md. Ingest raw/inbox/my-source.md with ontology-backed ingest and update the wiki.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Answer my question from the wiki and verify uncertain claims against warehouse/jsonl/.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Run a wiki health check and fix broken or missing cross-links.`

## Daily Workflow

1. Put a source into `raw/inbox/`
2. Register it with the CLI
3. Run ontology-backed ingest if available
4. Review changed wiki pages in Obsidian
5. Move the raw file into `raw/processed/` when you are happy

## Scaling Later

This starter kit intentionally avoids embeddings, vector infrastructure, and graph tooling by default.

You can later add:

- ontology extraction skills
- graph projection
- semantic retrieval
- git-based review workflows

Until then, the repo-local contracts and folder structure are enough to start compounding knowledge.

## Quick Start

### 1. Open This Folder As An Obsidian Vault

In Obsidian:

1. `Open folder as vault`
2. Select `{root}`

Recommended Obsidian settings:

- Files and Links -> `New link format`: `Relative path to file`
- Files and Links -> `Use [[Wikilinks]]`: enabled
- Files and Links -> `Attachment folder path`: `raw/assets`

Helpful plugins:

- `Dataview`
- `Web Clipper`
- `Templater` (optional)
- `Marp` (optional for decks)

### 2. Create A Virtual Environment

```bash
cd {root}
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python scripts/llm_wiki.py status
```

No third-party Python packages are required.

### 3. Add Sources

Drop files into `raw/inbox/`.

Examples:

- Markdown clipped from a web article
- Notes exported from Obsidian or Apple Notes
- Meeting transcripts
- Research summaries
- Plain text files

If a source is a PDF, web page, or image-heavy document, keep the raw file in `raw/inbox/` and either:

- also save a companion markdown/text note into `raw/notes/`, or
- ask me to read the file directly and write the wiki updates

### 4. Register A Source

Run:

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py ingest raw/inbox/my-source.md --title "My Source Title"
```

This does three things:

- creates a source page in `wiki/sources/`
- appends an ingest entry to `wiki/_meta/log.md`
- rebuilds `wiki/_meta/index.md`

This is source registration only.
It does not auto-summarize the source or perform ontology-backed ingest.
That is deliberate: the LLM or a higher-level ingest skill should read the source and write the synthesis with context.

### 5. Ask Me To Maintain The Wiki

Use prompts like:

- `Read raw/inbox/my-source.md and fully ingest it into the wiki.`
- `Update the relevant concept, entity, and project pages based on the new source.`
- `Create any missing pages that should exist after this ingest.`
- `Run a wiki health check and fix broken or missing cross-links.`
- `Answer my question using the wiki, then save the answer under wiki/analyses/.`

The operating rules I should follow are in `AGENTS.md`.

## Daily Workflow

### Ingest One Source Carefully

1. Put a source into `raw/inbox/`
2. Register it with the CLI
3. Ask me or an ontology-backed ingest skill to process it into the wiki
4. Review the changed pages in Obsidian
5. Move the raw file into `raw/processed/` when you are happy

### Batch Ingest

1. Put many files into `raw/inbox/`
2. Register each source with the CLI
3. Ask me or an ontology-backed ingest skill to process them one by one
4. Ask me to run `lint` and clean up gaps afterward

## Commands

### Status

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py status
```

Shows counts for raw files, wiki pages, log entries, and index entries.

### Rebuild Index

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py reindex
```

Recreates `wiki/_meta/index.md` from the current wiki pages.

### Lint

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py lint
```

Checks for:

- broken wikilinks
- orphan pages
- pages without YAML frontmatter

### Append A Log Entry

```bash
python scripts/llm_wiki.py log query "Compared two vendors and created a summary page."
```

## How To Have Me Maintain The Wiki Well

When you want me to work on this wiki, point me at this project root and say exactly what mode you want:

- `Ingest mode`: read a new source and integrate it
- `Query mode`: answer a question from the wiki and save the answer back
- `Lint mode`: inspect the wiki for health issues and fix them
- `Refactor mode`: improve page structure, naming, and linking without changing factual content

Good maintenance prompts:

- `Use AGENTS.md. Ingest raw/inbox/2026-04-08-openai-agents.md into the wiki.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Treat python scripts/llm_wiki.py ingest as source registration only, then run ontology-backed ingest.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Compare the two project pages and save the result under wiki/analyses/.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Run a lint pass, fix broken links, and update the dashboard.`
- `Use AGENTS.md. Read the last five log entries and continue the unfinished threads.`

## Suggested Ingest Routine

For best results, ask me to do this sequence on each source:

1. Read the raw source
2. Update the source page summary and metadata
3. Update affected overview, concept, entity, person, project, or timeline pages
4. Add or revise cross-links
5. Note contradictions, open questions, and follow-up leads
6. Rebuild index if new pages were created
7. Append a clear log entry

## Scaling Later

This starter kit intentionally avoids heavier infrastructure.

When the wiki grows, you can add:

- local search over markdown
- vector search
- Dataview dashboards
- graph analytics
- git-based review workflows

Until then, `index.md`, `log.md`, and the folder structure are enough to run today.
